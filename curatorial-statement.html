            <p><span>In </span><i><span>Paring Pairs, </span></i><span>paired artists piece together timelines,
                    evolutions,
                    and dualities. The pairs are working together for the first time, beginning shared creative
                    histories
                    with their collaborations. Worlds collide in both the collaborative process and the themes explored:
                    a
                    plant becomes human, daydreams permeate reality, present emulates past. The works slice through
                    personal
                    and systemic barriers, cutting away the obscurity of time, space, and matter to reveal parallel
                    evolutions and branching deviations.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>In </span><i><span>Changing Perspectives</span></i><span>, Angela Bernabeo and Jessica Lian splice
                    social demographics and individual interests to chronicle ongoing shifts in art and technology. In
                </span><span>[ ]</span><span> by Cindy Qiu and Anika Rios, humans step into the dance of nature, tuning
                    into
                    the elements. In </span><i><span>@TimewithThyme</span></i><span> by Anya Ballantyne and Jafrin
                    Uddin, a
                    plastic plant influencer shares its daily life, joining traditionally human circles physically and
                    virtually. In </span><i><span>Intertwined </span></i><span>by Nishat Farhana and Fariha Rahman,
                    manipulated urban photography reveals an alternate, dreamlike NYC. In </span><i><span>Discordant
                        Harmony
                    </span></i><span>by Olivia Pan and Allison Lai, two lives develop in parallel and out of step,
                    struggling to meet.</span></p>
            <p><span>The &ldquo;paring&rdquo; in </span><i><span>Paring Pairs</span></i><span> focuses on fabrication
                    rather
                    than elimination. In their tumble through feedback loops, the collaborations pick up new corners and
                    crannies, even as they are polished. It is a process of cutting the unexpected into the expected,
                    interrupting the status quo to make space for questions. </span><i><span>Paring Pairs
                    </span></i><span>invites you to cut into your assumptions and see what unfamiliar shapes reality can
                    take.</span></p>
