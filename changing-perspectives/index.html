                <p>In the 1940s, the term "computer" referred to the predominantly female workforce engaged in computational tasks, 
                  crucial for military and scientific efforts during World War II. This period emphasized women's central role in computing, 
                  treating programming as women's work. However, despite their critical contributions, these tasks were seen as low-status, 
                  reflecting societal perceptions that marginalized women's professional capabilities.

                clerical tasks to a technological and intellectual profession. This era marked the beginning of a transition, 
                subtly starting to alter the gender dynamics in computing, as the field gained prominence and recognition within state and industrial frameworks.

                 initiatives were launched to counter the declining participation of women in computer science, with outreach programs, scholarships,
                  and efforts to make curricula more inclusive. However, despite these efforts, the rapid expansion of the tech industry was predominantly
                   male-driven. This period's technological advances, while groundbreaking, coincided with a persistently low representation of women in the 
                   field, reflecting broader systemic issues that continued to marginalize women in computing.

                The digital divide—the gap between those with easy access to digital technology and those without—mirrored and perhaps even exacerbated the 
                gender gap in computer science, as access to technology became increasingly linked to success in the field.
